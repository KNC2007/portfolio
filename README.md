Professional Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio website is for Courtney Kalbach. There is one section on the right of the page. This section includes a headshot. There are three sections down the middle of the page: About Me, Works, and Contact. The About Me section tells a little about Courtney and her professional and personal life. The Works section includes one deployed application in which she did a code refactoring. There are two other boxes that have the images Coming Soon where future deployed applications will be placed. The Contact section at the bottom of the page includes Courtney's email address. The navigation icons are on the far right of the screen. Hover of the images to see the tooltips for the sections About Me, Works, and Contact. Click on the icons and the UI will scroll to that section of the page.
